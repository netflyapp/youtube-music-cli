## 3. Plan to Fix IDE Problems

1. **Missing `Track` Type Exports**: Identify where the `Track` interface has been moved to (likely `player.types.ts`) and update the imports in `plugins/lyrics/index.ts`, `plugins/discord-rpc/index.ts`, and `plugins/adblock/index.ts`.
2. **`PluginEvent` and `NavigationEvent` issues**: The payload for the plugin events has been refactored. The property `track` is no longer at the root of the event object. I will inspect `plugin.types.ts` to find the correct shape (e.g. `event.payload.track` or a type narrowed event based on event name) and update the hook handlers accordingly.
3. **`adblock/index.ts` Specific Fixes**:
   - `stream-request` lacking type assignment: Update the plugin hooks array type in the manifest or simply remove the invalid string.
   - `onStreamRequest` interface mismatch: Wait to see the exact signature in `plugin.types.ts`. Sometimes async returns are expected, but here we see a standard mismatch `Promise<string | null>` vs `string | null | Promise<string>`. That implies the return type signature on `context.audio.onStreamRequest` needs the handler to return `Promise<string>` but it returns `Promise<string | null>`. It might be expecting returning `url` or something specific.
   - `isAd(track)` parameter mismatch: Ensure the `duration` property has the correct `{ totalSeconds: number }` signature as defined by the latest `Track` type.
